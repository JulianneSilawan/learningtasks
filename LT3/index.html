				<center><h3> Life Goes On </h3></center>
				<center><p> This song belongs to my top 1 list since it was sang by a Kpop group named, BTS. This is a comforting song about motivating people to do more things in life even if we hit rock bottom. In order to live life, we need to be stronger mentally and physically and be around with the people you love and who loves you for who you are. </p></center>

				<center><p> This is my current on-repeat song on my Spotify playlist because of the nice flow and beat of the music. This song is about no matter how far you are or where you are from you loved one, you still strongly have feelings for them. Technically, it is a song for your one and only person and expressing how much you miss them dearly. </p></center>
